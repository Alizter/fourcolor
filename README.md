# The Four Color Theorem
The repository contains a [mechanization](http://www.ams.org/notices/200811/tx081101382p.pdf) of 
the [Four Color Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem)(Appel & Haken, 1976), 
a landmark result of graph theory.

The formal proof is based on the [Mathematical Components](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp)
library for the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) proof assistant.
